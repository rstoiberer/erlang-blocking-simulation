# üìû Erlang-B Blocking Probability Simulator  
**M/M/c/c Queueing Simulation with Exponential and Erlang Service Times**

This project models an M/M/c/c queue ‚Äî a loss system with no buffer ‚Äî to analyze blocking probabilities. It compares theoretical results using the Erlang-B formula with simulation-based estimates using both exponential and two-stage Erlang-distributed service times.

## üìö Project Context

Agner Erlang, a Danish engineer and mathematician, created foundational models of telephone traffic in the early 1900s. This project replicates one such model: the **M/M/c/c queue**, where:

- Customers arrive via a **Poisson process (Œª)**
- Service times are **exponentially distributed (s)** or follow a **two-stage Erlang distribution**
- There are **c servers** and **no waiting queue**: blocked calls are dropped

---

## üîç What This Project Does

- Implements the **Erlang-B formula** to compute theoretical blocking probabilities
- Uses **binary search** to determine the number of servers needed for desired performance
- Simulates an **M/M/c/c system** with both:
  - Exponentially distributed service times
  - Two-stage Erlang service times (sum of two exponentials)
- Compares theoretical and simulated blocking probabilities across multiple trials

---

## üß™ Key Concepts

- **Erlang-B Formula:**  
  Calculates the probability that a customer is blocked in an M/M/c/c system:
  
  Blocking probability:
  ```
  B(m, E) = (E^m / m!) / Œ£_{j=0}^m (E^j / j!)
  ```
- **Erlang Service Time:**  
  Two-stage Erlang is generated as:  
  ```
  np.random.exponential(s/2) + np.random.exponential(s/2)
  ```
  Blocking Probability:
Simulated as the fraction of customers dropped when all servers are busy.

  Difference: 0 servers

Analysis: Both distributions require the same number of servers.
This suggests that for this specific arrival rate and blocking probability target,
the reduced variability of the Erlang distribution doesn't impact capacity requirements.
